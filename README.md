# 👋 Welcome to my travel website! 

Don't judge, this is just one of my attempts to design the site nicely.
I've finished the layout, but the site only looks normal on my laptop. 
<div align="center">
  <img src="screen.jpg" >
</div>

### 📋 The site has:


- a home page;

-  a page with the tours that the user has chosen (without javascript it does not work yet);

- and a page with all the tours;
